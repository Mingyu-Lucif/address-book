# Wake Down

First Tab : From the data parsed from dummy.json we created DUMMY Classes. And initiated MyAdapter to process these classes into listview. The button on the right supports calling.

Second Tab : The images that are added to res/drawable are shown on gridview. Each imageviews are touchable from FullImageActivity so that the images are processed.

Third Tab : Wake Down alarm. This alarm works in a weird matter. The alarm rings at a set time. However, in order to turn the alarm off, the user need to enter the password shown on the left. The password consists of I and l in a random sequence generated at the setalarm phase.
